Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.

## Intuition
The problem requires finding the shortest path between two nodes in a binary tree. Given the structure of a binary tree, the shortest path can be found by identifying the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes. From the LCA, the path to the destination node can be traced. We can break this down into three main steps: finding paths from the root to the start and destination nodes, identifying the LCA from these paths, and generating the step-by-step directions from the start node to the destination node.

## Approach
1. **Finding Paths**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the paths from the root to the start node (`startValue`) and from the root to the destination node (`destValue`). These paths will be stored as lists of directions ('L' for left and 'R' for right).

2. **Finding LCA**: By comparing the paths to the start and destination nodes, determine where they diverge. The last common node in these paths before they diverge is the LCA.

3. **Generating Directions**: From the start node, move up to the LCA, and then move down to the destination node. 
   - The steps from the start node to the LCA are represented by 'U' (up) directions.
   - The steps from the LCA to the destination node are the remaining part of the path to the destination node.

4. **Combining Directions**: Concatenate the 'U' directions and the path from the LCA to the destination node to form the complete direction string.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - Finding the paths from the root to the start and destination nodes requires traversing the tree, which takes $$O(n)$$ time, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Comparing the two paths to find the LCA takes $$O(h)$$ time, where $$h$$ is the height of the tree. In the worst case, $$h = n$$ for a skewed tree.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is $$O(n)$$.

- **Space complexity**:
  - The space needed to store the paths from the root to the start and destination nodes is $$O(h)$$ each.
  - In the worst case, the height of the tree is $$h = n$$.
  - Thus, the overall space complexity is $$O(n)$$.

        if (node == null) return false;
        if (node.val == value) return true;
        
        // Search in the left subtree
        path.Add('L');
        if (FindPath(node.left, value, path)) return true;
        path.RemoveAt(path.Count - 1);

        path.Add('R');
